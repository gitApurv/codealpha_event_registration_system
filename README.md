# Event Registration System API

A robust backend API for a full-featured event registration platform. This system allows administrators to manage events and enables users to register for them, with secure authentication and role-based access control.

## Features ‚ú®

- **User Authentication**: Secure user registration and login system using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**.
- **Password Hashing**: Passwords are encrypted using **bcrypt.js** before being stored.
- **Role-Based Access Control**: Differentiates between regular `users` and `admins` to protect sensitive routes.
- **Event Management (Admin)**: Admins have full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) capabilities for events.
- **Event Discovery (Public)**: Anyone can view a list of all available events and see the details for a specific event.
- **User Registration**: Authenticated users can register for events and cancel their registrations.
- **Personalized Dashboard**: Users can view a list of all events they have registered for.
- **Scalable Architecture**: Organized into a clean structure of models, views, and controllers for easy maintenance.
